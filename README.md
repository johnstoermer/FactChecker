# FactChecker

News and Politicians often say incorrect statements in their articles or speeches spreading unwarranted anger and fear in the general public. This chrome extension is an attempt to prevent such factual inconsistencies.

## Summary
The chrome extension goes through the contents of the webpage and matches it with keywords collected from Politifact. If there is a match, it displays a popup regarding the article informing the user if there is something factually incorrect on the page.

## TODO
- Populate a larger database for the extension by adding more factual sources.
- Make the Fact Checker faster
